Citations tirées du livre "Cultivating food justice. Race, Class and Sustainability" d'Alison Hope Atkinson et Julian Agyeman.

  "The concept of positionality, the understanding that our life experiences and practices are deeply entangled with the ways we see the world."

  "My early research arose from my personal and political interest in place, examining its relationship with meaning-making processes and power."

  "The food movement is responding to popular anxieties that modern life is alienating and antisocial, and an American mythology that locates the good life in romanticised small towns."

  "But such a consistent narrative, doing with the movement's predominantly white and middle-class character, suggests that it may itself be something of a monoculture. It consists of a group of 'like-minded' people, with similar backgrounds, values and proclivities, who have come to similar conclusions about how our food system should change."

  "The dominant narrative [of the food movement] described earlier, compelling as it may be to some, might drown out other stories. In these additional stories, food is not only linked to ecological sustainability, community, health, but also to racial, economic and environmental justice. Our goal in highlighting these additional stories is not to chastise the food movement, but to build a stronger and deeper critique of industrialized agriculture."

  "This alliance will require that the food movement reach beyond its dominant narrative to understand the experiences and perspectives of its potential allies."

  "Essentialist notions of race and racism ignore the socially constructed and lived dynamics of racial identities and oppressions."

  "The food justice scholarship can also help the environmental justice literature to incorporate more theoretically sophisticated understandings of race."
